<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Naresh Madiraju, and I am a graphic and Brand identity designer.<br/> 
  I am passionate about visual communication and creating designs that effectively convey<br/> 
  messages and ideas to audiences. With several years of experience in the field, I have<br/> 
  developed a diverse skill set, including proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and<br/> 
  InDesign, among other design software and tools. As a graphic designer, I believe effective<br/> 
  visual communication is essential for businesses and individuals to achieve their goals and<br/> 
  connect with their audiences. I am excited to continue using my skills and creativity to help<br/> 
  my clients bring their ideas to life and tell their stories through compelling design.
